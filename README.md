## Methodology

This analysis followed a structured data analytics process to ensure accuracy and reliability. The sales data was cleaned and validated to remove inconsistencies and confirm numerical correctness. Date and time fields were standardized to support time-based analysis, and additional features such as time-of-day groupings, pizza categories, and pricing ranges were created to deepen insight. Exploratory analysis was then carried out to identify demand patterns, customer preferences, and product performance. Finally, results were aggregated to highlight key revenue drivers, and insights were presented through an interactive dashboard designed to support quick, executive-level decision-making.
